# GShade
**GShade is a highly modified ReShade fork & utility package with numerous improvements and settings autodetection for over 300 games.** 

Note that all shaders in this repository are strictly intended for use with the latest GShade release. Not all shaders will work under normal ReShade builds due to the implementation of GShade's additional features. Please refer to the [license](https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade/blob/master/LICENSE.md) on the repository **and** individual file licenses for questions about distribution and modification.

**The latest release can always be found here, and on Windows the use of the installer is required:** https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade/releases/latest
