# GShade-Shaders
Shaders modified and/or created for the GShade package, a highly modified ReShade fork & package with a network-unlocked depth buffer. 

Note that all shaders in this repository are strictly intended for use with ReShade 4+. Please refer to individual file licenses for questions about distribution and modification.

GShade itself is locked to and focused around specific online games including Final Fantasy XIV, Elder Scrolls Online, Black Desert Online, Warframe, Second Life (Official, Firestorm, Black Dragon), and more.

The installer version also includes an update utility, preset converter (for ReShade 3/ReShade 4/Stormshade/MoogleShade/HQ Shade/Dark Veil/Faeshade presets), optional desktop update reminder, and uninstaller.

The latest release can always be found over here, with the installer being highly recommended: https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade-Shaders/releases/latest
